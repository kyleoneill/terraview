# TerraView
This project is an educational attempt to learn how to read terraria WLD files and how to read/modify binary files with Rust. The program takes a Terraria world file and removes all corruption/crimson/hallow from the world. The `wld_docs` folder contains documentation about the .WLD file structure, with information being gathered from the references below and updated by me for the new 1.4 format.
